This is an experimental exercise to recreate an old map of Saigon in 1861 using Minecraft and further processed exporting as interactive web map based on the leaflet.js library. The map is one of the first maps created after the French took control over Saigon in 1859 and delineates the citadel in the heart of what is now District 1 and the Ki-Hoa fortress in the north-west.
